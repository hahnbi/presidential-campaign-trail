This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair ([Jay Chen](https://github.com/jchen85)).

This project is a d3.js visualization of campaign expenditures from presidential candidates in 2015.

##Objectives
- Learn how to use a new framework (d3.js) by looking at documentation and examples.
- Use an existing data set to create a data visualization that presents information in an appealing and efficient manner.

# Setup
To avoid CORS issues, you will need to host these files on a server. Then, just open `index.html` to see the visualization.
